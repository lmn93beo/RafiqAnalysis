Notes on Rafiq's data in For Nhat:

* raw_c: Raw trace of contra trials
1572 units
Frequency is 5 Hz
Each cell has dimension time points x trials

* mvmt_start is calculated based on fballX by looking at the acceleration and 
see when it crosses a threshold
reward_time can have different thresholds depending on the mouse and session

* fballc_data: 200 frames, 100 frames/s, each frame is 0.01s



* ref_table:
Col 1: unit number
Col 2: session number (can have same mouse for different sessions)
Col 3: unit number within session
Col 4: Whether unit is SC-projecting
Col 5: Whether unit is trial-modulated
Col 6: NaN: not trial-modulated, OR not SC-projecting
	   0: stim-modulated, but contra/ipsi non-specific
	   1: contra prefering
	   2: ipsi prefering (TODO: CHECK)
	   
Note that 0,1,2 are only calculated for SC-projecting cells
